# Codex execution contract

This recipe was adapted from a pinned public source. Its domain guidance is reusable;
its historical provider examples are not a live capability registry.

1. Resolve `${CODEX_PACK_ROOT}` from the installed `hamidun-pack` entrypoint. It is a documentation root, not an environment variable automatically created by Codex.
2. Native tool mapping: Claude `Read/Glob/Grep` means available file/search tools; `Bash` means the current shell; `Write/Edit/MultiEdit` means the supported patch/file tool. Claude `Task/Agent` means native collaboration with a concrete bounded subtask, only when delegation is authorized. Tool names inside old examples are illustrative, not callable API schemas.
3. Claude slash commands become catalog recipes. They are not automatically registered as Codex slash commands. Pass arguments explicitly in the task.
4. Do not execute files ending in `.source`, upstream hook examples, or paths containing `UPSTREAM_HOME`. They are quarantined reference code, NOT a validated runtime. A dependent workflow must first receive a reviewed Codex-owned adapter with explicit state/output roots and tests, or use an available native capability.
5. Do not load secrets, session databases, private memory, or Claude model/provider defaults. Resolve integrations and named environment variables only when required and authorized.
6. Model IDs, MCP names, permission snippets and scheduled-job examples in the source are historical. Check current supported equivalents. Never activate them just because a recipe mentions them.
7. Prefer native image generation, documents and browser tooling where available. Do not install dependencies or authorize a third party as a side effect of reading this recipe.
8. Preserve scope and output requirements. Mark unavailable dependencies clearly; do not claim a recipe passed a live test from a syntax/manifest check.

## Adapted domain recipe


<objective>
Extract implementation decisions that downstream agents need — researcher and planner will use CONTEXT.md to know what to investigate and what choices are locked.

**How it works:**
1. Load prior context (PROJECT.md, REQUIREMENTS.md, STATE.md, prior CONTEXT.md files)
2. Scout codebase for reusable assets and patterns
3. Analyze phase — skip gray areas already decided in prior phases
4. Present remaining gray areas — user selects which to discuss
5. Deep-dive each selected area until satisfied
6. Create CONTEXT.md with decisions that guide research and planning

**Output:** `{phase_num}-CONTEXT.md` — decisions clear enough that downstream agents can act without asking the user again
</objective>

<execution_context>
@${CODEX_PACK_ROOT}/library/get-shit-done/workflows/discuss-phase.md
@${CODEX_PACK_ROOT}/library/get-shit-done/workflows/discuss-phase-assumptions.md
@${CODEX_PACK_ROOT}/library/get-shit-done/templates/context.md
</execution_context>

<context>
Phase number: $ARGUMENTS (required)

Context files are resolved in-workflow using `init phase-op` and roadmap/state tool calls.
</context>

<process>
**Mode routing:**
```bash
DISCUSS_MODE=$(node "${CODEX_PACK_ROOT}/library/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs" config-get workflow.discuss_mode 2>/dev/null || echo "discuss")
```

If `DISCUSS_MODE` is `"assumptions"`: Read and execute @${CODEX_PACK_ROOT}/library/get-shit-done/workflows/discuss-phase-assumptions.md end-to-end.

If `DISCUSS_MODE` is `"discuss"` (or unset, or any other value): Read and execute @${CODEX_PACK_ROOT}/library/get-shit-done/workflows/discuss-phase.md end-to-end.

**MANDATORY:** The execution_context files listed above ARE the instructions. Read the workflow file BEFORE taking any action. The objective and success_criteria sections in this command file are summaries — the workflow file contains the complete step-by-step process with all required behaviors, config checks, and interaction patterns. Do not improvise from the summary.
</process>

<success_criteria>
- Prior context loaded and applied (no re-asking decided questions)
- Gray areas identified through intelligent analysis
- User chose which areas to discuss
- Each selected area explored until satisfied
- Scope creep redirected to deferred ideas
- CONTEXT.md captures decisions, not vague vision
- User knows next steps
</success_criteria>
