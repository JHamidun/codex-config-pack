# Codex execution contract

This recipe was adapted from a pinned public source. Its domain guidance is reusable;
its historical provider examples are not a live capability registry.

1. Resolve `${CODEX_PACK_ROOT}` from the installed `hamidun-pack` entrypoint. It is a documentation root, not an environment variable automatically created by Codex.
2. Native tool mapping: Claude `Read/Glob/Grep` means available file/search tools; `Bash` means the current shell; `Write/Edit/MultiEdit` means the supported patch/file tool. Claude `Task/Agent` means native collaboration with a concrete bounded subtask, only when delegation is authorized. Tool names inside old examples are illustrative, not callable API schemas.
3. Claude slash commands become catalog recipes. They are not automatically registered as Codex slash commands. Pass arguments explicitly in the task.
4. Do not execute files ending in `.source`, upstream hook examples, or paths containing `UPSTREAM_HOME`. They are quarantined reference code, NOT a validated runtime. A dependent workflow must first receive a reviewed Codex-owned adapter with explicit state/output roots and tests, or use an available native capability.
5. Do not load secrets, session databases, private memory, or Claude model/provider defaults. Resolve integrations and named environment variables only when required and authorized.
6. Model IDs, MCP names, permission snippets and scheduled-job examples in the source are historical. Check current supported equivalents. Never activate them just because a recipe mentions them.
7. Prefer native image generation, documents and browser tooling where available. Do not install dependencies or authorize a third party as a side effect of reading this recipe.
8. Preserve scope and output requirements. Mark unavailable dependencies clearly; do not claim a recipe passed a live test from a syntax/manifest check.

## Adapted domain recipe


# Prompt Log Analyzer

Parse Claude Code session JSONL files and extract usage statistics.

## Data Source

Session files: `${CODEX_PACK_ROOT}/library/projects/*/*.jsonl`

## Analysis Steps

### 1. Find Recent Sessions
```bash
powershell -c "Get-ChildItem -Path $env:USERPROFILE\.claude\projects -Recurse -Filter '*.jsonl' | Sort-Object LastWriteTime -Descending | Select-Object -First 10 | Format-Table Name, @{N='Size(KB)';E={[math]::Round($_.Length/1KB,1)}}, LastWriteTime"
```

### 2. Parse Session Data
For each JSONL file, extract:
- **Message count** — total messages in session
- **Tool calls** — which tools were used and how often
- **Session duration** — first to last timestamp
- **File size** — proxy for token usage

### 3. Aggregate Statistics
```bash
powershell -c @"
$files = Get-ChildItem -Path $env:USERPROFILE\.claude\projects -Recurse -Filter '*.jsonl'
$totalSize = ($files | Measure-Object -Property Length -Sum).Sum
$count = $files.Count
Write-Output "Total sessions: $count"
Write-Output "Total size: $([math]::Round($totalSize/1MB, 2)) MB"
Write-Output "Avg session: $([math]::Round($totalSize/$count/1KB, 1)) KB"
"@
```

## Report Format

```markdown
# Session Statistics

## Overview
- Total sessions: N
- Total data: X MB
- Average session size: Y KB
- Date range: [first] - [last]

## Recent Sessions (last 10)
| Date | Size | Duration |
|------|------|----------|

## Tool Usage (top 10)
| Tool | Count | % of total |
|------|-------|------------|

## Patterns
- Most active day of week: [day]
- Average session size trend: [growing/stable/shrinking]
- Most used agents: [list]

## Recommendations
- [Based on patterns]
```

## Process

1. Scan all JSONL files in projects directory
2. Parse recent files for detailed analysis
3. Calculate aggregated statistics
4. Identify patterns and trends
5. Generate report
6. Optionally save insights to vector memory
