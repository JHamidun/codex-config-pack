# Codex execution contract

This recipe was adapted from a pinned public source. Its domain guidance is reusable;
its historical provider examples are not a live capability registry.

1. Resolve `${CODEX_PACK_ROOT}` from the installed `hamidun-pack` entrypoint. It is a documentation root, not an environment variable automatically created by Codex.
2. Native tool mapping: Claude `Read/Glob/Grep` means available file/search tools; `Bash` means the current shell; `Write/Edit/MultiEdit` means the supported patch/file tool. Claude `Task/Agent` means native collaboration with a concrete bounded subtask, only when delegation is authorized. Tool names inside old examples are illustrative, not callable API schemas.
3. Claude slash commands become catalog recipes. They are not automatically registered as Codex slash commands. Pass arguments explicitly in the task.
4. Do not execute files ending in `.source`, upstream hook examples, or paths containing `UPSTREAM_HOME`. They are quarantined reference code, NOT a validated runtime. A dependent workflow must first receive a reviewed Codex-owned adapter with explicit state/output roots and tests, or use an available native capability.
5. Do not load secrets, session databases, private memory, or Claude model/provider defaults. Resolve integrations and named environment variables only when required and authorized.
6. Model IDs, MCP names, permission snippets and scheduled-job examples in the source are historical. Check current supported equivalents. Never activate them just because a recipe mentions them.
7. Prefer native image generation, documents and browser tooling where available. Do not install dependencies or authorize a third party as a side effect of reading this recipe.
8. Preserve scope and output requirements. Mark unavailable dependencies clearly; do not claim a recipe passed a live test from a syntax/manifest check.

## Adapted domain recipe


# /sprint-planning

> If you see unfamiliar placeholders or need to check which tools are connected, see the MCP registry: `${CODEX_PACK_ROOT}/library/config/mcp-servers.md`.

Plan a sprint by scoping work, estimating capacity, and setting clear goals.

## Usage

```
/sprint-planning $ARGUMENTS
```

## What I Need From You

- **Team**: Who's on the team and their availability this sprint?
- **Sprint length**: How many days/weeks?
- **Backlog**: What's prioritized? (Pull from tracker, paste, or describe)
- **Carryover**: Anything unfinished from last sprint?
- **Dependencies**: Anything blocked on other teams?

## Output

```markdown
## Sprint Plan: [Sprint Name]
**Dates:** [Start] — [End] | **Team:** [X] engineers
**Sprint Goal:** [One clear sentence about what success looks like]

### Capacity
| Person | Available Days | Allocation | Notes |
|--------|---------------|------------|-------|
| [Name] | [X] of [Y] | [X] points/hours | [PTO, on-call, etc.] |
| **Total** | **[X]** | **[X] points** | |

### Sprint Backlog
| Priority | Item | Estimate | Owner | Dependencies |
|----------|------|----------|-------|--------------|
| P0 | [Must ship] | [X] pts | [Person] | [None / Blocked by X] |
| P1 | [Should ship] | [X] pts | [Person] | [None] |
| P2 | [Stretch] | [X] pts | [Person] | [None] |

### Planned Capacity: [X] points | Sprint Load: [X] points ([X]% of capacity)

### Risks
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| [Risk] | [What happens] | [What to do] |

### Definition of Done
- [ ] Code reviewed and merged
- [ ] Tests passing
- [ ] Documentation updated (if applicable)
- [ ] Product sign-off

### Key Dates
| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| [Date] | Sprint start |
| [Date] | Mid-sprint check-in |
| [Date] | Sprint end / Demo |
| [Date] | Retro |
```

## Tips

1. **Leave buffer** — Plan to 70-80% capacity. You will get interrupts.
2. **One clear sprint goal** — If you can't state it in one sentence, the sprint is unfocused.
3. **Identify stretch items** — Know what to cut if things take longer than expected.
4. **Carry over honestly** — If something didn't ship, understand why before re-committing.
