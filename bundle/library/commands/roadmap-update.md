# Codex execution contract

This recipe was adapted from a pinned public source. Its domain guidance is reusable;
its historical provider examples are not a live capability registry.

1. Resolve `${CODEX_PACK_ROOT}` from the installed `hamidun-pack` entrypoint. It is a documentation root, not an environment variable automatically created by Codex.
2. Native tool mapping: Claude `Read/Glob/Grep` means available file/search tools; `Bash` means the current shell; `Write/Edit/MultiEdit` means the supported patch/file tool. Claude `Task/Agent` means native collaboration with a concrete bounded subtask, only when delegation is authorized. Tool names inside old examples are illustrative, not callable API schemas.
3. Claude slash commands become catalog recipes. They are not automatically registered as Codex slash commands. Pass arguments explicitly in the task.
4. Do not execute files ending in `.source`, upstream hook examples, or paths containing `UPSTREAM_HOME`. They are quarantined reference code, NOT a validated runtime. A dependent workflow must first receive a reviewed Codex-owned adapter with explicit state/output roots and tests, or use an available native capability.
5. Do not load secrets, session databases, private memory, or Claude model/provider defaults. Resolve integrations and named environment variables only when required and authorized.
6. Model IDs, MCP names, permission snippets and scheduled-job examples in the source are historical. Check current supported equivalents. Never activate them just because a recipe mentions them.
7. Prefer native image generation, documents and browser tooling where available. Do not install dependencies or authorize a third party as a side effect of reading this recipe.
8. Preserve scope and output requirements. Mark unavailable dependencies clearly; do not claim a recipe passed a live test from a syntax/manifest check.

# Roadmap Update

> If you see unfamiliar placeholders or need to check which tools are connected, see the MCP registry: `${CODEX_PACK_ROOT}/library/config/mcp-servers.md`.

Update, create, or reprioritize a product roadmap.

## Usage

```
/roadmap-update $ARGUMENTS
```

## Workflow

### 1. Understand Current State

If **project tracker** is connected:
- Pull current roadmap items with their statuses, assignees, and dates
- Identify items that are overdue, at risk, or recently completed
- Surface any items without clear owners or dates

If no project management tool is connected:
- Ask the user to describe their current roadmap or paste/upload it
- Accept any format: list, table, spreadsheet, screenshot, or prose description

### 2. Determine the Operation

Ask what the user wants to do:

**Add item**: New feature, initiative, or work item to the roadmap
- Gather: name, description, priority, estimated effort, target timeframe, owner, dependencies
- Suggest where it fits based on current priorities and capacity

**Update status**: Change status of existing items
- Options: not started, in progress, at risk, blocked, completed, cut
- For "at risk" or "blocked": ask for the blocker and mitigation plan

**Reprioritize**: Change the order or priority of items
- Ask what changed (new information, strategy shift, resource change, customer feedback)
- Apply a prioritization framework if helpful — see the **roadmap-management** skill for RICE, MoSCoW, ICE, and value-vs-effort frameworks
- Show before/after comparison

**Move timeline**: Shift dates for items
- Ask why (scope change, dependency slip, resource constraint)
- Identify downstream impacts on dependent items
- Flag items that move past hard deadlines

**Create new roadmap**: Build a roadmap from scratch
- Ask about timeframe (quarter, half, year)
- Ask about format preference (Now/Next/Later, quarterly columns, OKR-aligned)
- Gather the list of initiatives to include

### 3. Generate Roadmap Summary

Produce a roadmap view with:

#### Status Overview
Quick summary: X items in progress, Y completed this period, Z at risk.

#### Roadmap Items
For each item, show:
- Name and one-line description
- Status indicator (on track / at risk / blocked / completed / not started)
- Target timeframe or date
- Owner
- Key dependencies

Group items by:
- Timeframe (Now / Next / Later) or quarter, depending on format
- Or by theme/goal if the user prefers

#### Risks and Dependencies
- Items that are blocked or at risk, with details
- Cross-team dependencies and their status
- Items approaching hard deadlines

#### Changes This Update
If this is an update to an existing roadmap, summarize what changed:
- Items added, removed, or reprioritized
- Timeline shifts
- Status changes

### 4. Follow Up

After generating the roadmap:
- Offer to format for a specific audience (executive summary, engineering detail, customer-facing)
- Offer to draft communication about roadmap changes
- If project management tool is connected, offer to update ticket statuses

## Output Format

Use a clear, scannable format. Tables work well for roadmap items. Use text status labels: **Done**, **On Track**, **At Risk**, **Blocked**, **Not Started**.

## Tips

- A roadmap is a communication tool, not a project plan. Keep it at the right altitude — themes and outcomes, not tasks.
- When reprioritizing, always ask what changed. Priority shifts should be driven by new information, not whim.
- Flag capacity issues early. If the roadmap has more work than the team can handle, say so.
- Dependencies are the biggest risk to roadmaps. Surface them explicitly.
- If the user asks to add something, always ask what comes off or moves. Roadmaps are zero-sum against capacity.
