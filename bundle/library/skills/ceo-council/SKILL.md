# Codex execution contract

This recipe was adapted from a pinned public source. Its domain guidance is reusable;
its historical provider examples are not a live capability registry.

1. Resolve `${CODEX_PACK_ROOT}` from the installed `hamidun-pack` entrypoint. It is a documentation root, not an environment variable automatically created by Codex.
2. Native tool mapping: Claude `Read/Glob/Grep` means available file/search tools; `Bash` means the current shell; `Write/Edit/MultiEdit` means the supported patch/file tool. Claude `Task/Agent` means native collaboration with a concrete bounded subtask, only when delegation is authorized. Tool names inside old examples are illustrative, not callable API schemas.
3. Claude slash commands become catalog recipes. They are not automatically registered as Codex slash commands. Pass arguments explicitly in the task.
4. Do not execute files ending in `.source`, upstream hook examples, or paths containing `UPSTREAM_HOME`. They are quarantined reference code, NOT a validated runtime. A dependent workflow must first receive a reviewed Codex-owned adapter with explicit state/output roots and tests, or use an available native capability.
5. Do not load secrets, session databases, private memory, or Claude model/provider defaults. Resolve integrations and named environment variables only when required and authorized.
6. Model IDs, MCP names, permission snippets and scheduled-job examples in the source are historical. Check current supported equivalents. Never activate them just because a recipe mentions them.
7. Prefer native image generation, documents and browser tooling where available. Do not install dependencies or authorize a third party as a side effect of reading this recipe.
8. Preserve scope and output requirements. Mark unavailable dependencies clearly; do not claim a recipe passed a live test from a syntax/manifest check.

## Adapted domain recipe


# CEO Council — Independent Strategic Analysis

Launch parallel sub-agents as isolated C-level experts. Each analyzes the same project data from their perspective. No coordination between experts — isolation produces genuine diversity of opinion. Then synthesize consensus and disagreements.

## Critical: How to Launch Experts

**MUST use the Task tool** with `subagent_type: "general-purpose"` and `model: inherit-current-codex-model`.

```
Task(
  subagent_type: "general-purpose",
  model: inherit-current-codex-model,
  prompt: "<expert prompt with data>",
  description: "CFO analysis"
)
```

**DO NOT** use bash, shell scripts, or background commands to launch experts. They will fail.

Launch all experts in a **single message with multiple Task tool calls** for true parallelism.

## Step 1: Scan Project Context

Before suggesting experts, understand the project:

1. Read `CLAUDE.md` (or `README.md` if absent)
2. Scan `.claude/rules/` for domain context
3. Glance at top-level file structure

Based on findings, **generate 4-6 expert roles tailored to THIS project**. Roles must reflect the project's actual domain, challenges, and stage.

## Step 2: Assemble the Council

**MANDATORY: Ask the user before proceeding.** Do not pick roles yourself.

Use `AskUserQuestion` with `multiSelect: true`:
- Show 4-6 role options with short descriptions of their focus
- User can always pick "Other" to define custom roles
- **Minimum 2 experts.** If user picks 1, suggest adding one more for productive disagreement

### Role Examples by Project Type

**Don't copy these** — generate fresh roles based on actual project context:

| Project Type | Typical Roles |
|-------------|--------------|
| **SaaS** | Head of Engineering, Head of Product, Head of Growth, CFO, UX Researcher |
| **Open Source** | Community Manager, Technical Architect, DevRel, Security Advisor |
| **Content / Media** | Content Strategist, Audience Analyst, Monetization Expert, Distribution Expert |
| **EdTech** | CMO, CFO, CPO, COO, Growth Advisor |
| **E-commerce** | Head of Supply Chain, Marketing Director, CTO, Customer Experience Lead |
| **Agency / Consulting** | Sales Director, Delivery Lead, Talent Manager, CFO |

## Step 3: Gather Current Data

Collect project state to feed all experts. Stay focused on what's relevant:

**Read:**
- Key metrics/data files identified during context scan
- Strategy and planning documents
- Recent decisions or changes (git log --oneline -10)
- Previous council analyses (if any)

**Skip:** GitHub traffic stats, stargazer counts, clone data, contributor lists — these are vanity metrics, not strategic data.

**All experts must receive identical data context.** Prepare the data block ONCE, then paste it into each expert prompt.

## Step 4: Generate Expert Prompts

For each selected expert, create a prompt with the SAME data block:

```
You are the [ROLE] for [PROJECT NAME]. Analyze the data below from a [DOMAIN] perspective.

Focus on:
- [3-6 specific focus areas relevant to role and project]

Data:
[CURRENT PROJECT DATA — identical for all experts]

[Role-specific instruction: "show the math", "be the contrarian", "prioritize by effort/impact", etc.]

Respond in the same language as the data provided.
```

**Rules:**
- Each expert gets the SAME data block — prepare it once, reuse
- Focus areas must be specific to the project, not generic
- Include a personality instruction (contrarian, pragmatic, data-driven)
- Mention project constraints the expert should know

## Step 5: Execute

Launch ALL selected experts in **one message** using multiple Task tool calls:

```
# In a single response, call Task for each expert:
Task(subagent_type: "general-purpose", model: inherit-current-codex-model, prompt: "<CFO prompt>", description: "CFO analysis")
Task(subagent_type: "general-purpose", model: inherit-current-codex-model, prompt: "<CPO prompt>", description: "CPO analysis")
Task(subagent_type: "general-purpose", model: inherit-current-codex-model, prompt: "<CTO prompt>", description: "CTO analysis")
```

Wait for all experts to return results before proceeding to synthesis.

## Step 6: Synthesize

**Do not skip this step.** The synthesis is the entire value of the council.

After all experts report, create a synthesis document:

```markdown
# Council Session: [DATE]

## Council Members
[List of selected experts and their focus]

## Context
[Current metrics/state snapshot — brief]

## [Expert 1 Name]
[Key findings and recommendations]

## [Expert 2 Name]
[Key findings and recommendations]

## Consensus (all agree)
1. ...
2. ...

## Disagreements
| Expert | Position | Argument |
|--------|----------|----------|
| ... | ... | ... |

## Decisions
_To be filled after discussion._
```

### Consensus Rules (evidence > votes)

- **Triage, not averaging.** Sort expert outputs into: Consensus (2+ agree) / Expert-only (unique points per expert) / Disagreements. Adjudicate each disagreement explicitly — never split the difference.
- **Evidence beats vote count.** One expert citing a verifiable number/source from the data block beats three experts agreeing from intuition. All experts run on the same base model — unanimous agreement without evidence is a shared-prior echo (consensus hallucination), not a truth signal. Tag such items `[CONSENSUS-only — no supporting data]` in the synthesis.
- **MODEL_ECHO (if experts run on different models** via `gpt-agent`/`gemini-agent`): require first line `MODEL_ECHO=<model id>` in each expert reply — catches silent fallback where "diverse council" is secretly one model. Mismatched echo → mark that expert degraded.

### Save Results

Save to a logical location:
- `docs/council-[DATE].md` — default
- Or project-specific path if context suggests one

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Picking roles without asking user | ALWAYS use AskUserQuestion first |
| Using bash to launch experts | ONLY use Task tool with subagent_type: "general-purpose" |
| Giving experts different data | Prepare ONE data block, paste into all prompts |
| Gathering vanity metrics | Focus on project docs, strategy, actual metrics |
| Too many experts (6+) | 3-4 is optimal for signal-to-noise |
| Skipping synthesis | The synthesis IS the value — never skip |
