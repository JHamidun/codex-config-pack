# Codex execution contract

This recipe was adapted from a pinned public source. Its domain guidance is reusable;
its historical provider examples are not a live capability registry.

1. Resolve `${CODEX_PACK_ROOT}` from the installed `hamidun-pack` entrypoint. It is a documentation root, not an environment variable automatically created by Codex.
2. Native tool mapping: Claude `Read/Glob/Grep` means available file/search tools; `Bash` means the current shell; `Write/Edit/MultiEdit` means the supported patch/file tool. Claude `Task/Agent` means native collaboration with a concrete bounded subtask, only when delegation is authorized. Tool names inside old examples are illustrative, not callable API schemas.
3. Claude slash commands become catalog recipes. They are not automatically registered as Codex slash commands. Pass arguments explicitly in the task.
4. Do not execute files ending in `.source`, upstream hook examples, or paths containing `UPSTREAM_HOME`. They are quarantined reference code, NOT a validated runtime. A dependent workflow must first receive a reviewed Codex-owned adapter with explicit state/output roots and tests, or use an available native capability.
5. Do not load secrets, session databases, private memory, or Claude model/provider defaults. Resolve integrations and named environment variables only when required and authorized.
6. Model IDs, MCP names, permission snippets and scheduled-job examples in the source are historical. Check current supported equivalents. Never activate them just because a recipe mentions them.
7. Prefer native image generation, documents and browser tooling where available. Do not install dependencies or authorize a third party as a side effect of reading this recipe.
8. Preserve scope and output requirements. Mark unavailable dependencies clearly; do not claim a recipe passed a live test from a syntax/manifest check.

## Adapted domain recipe


# Python Full-Stack Development

Covers Django, FastAPI, Flask, SQLAlchemy, pytest and deployment. Telegram bots are
a separate skill (`telegram-bot-toolkit`) — they have their own runtime and gotchas.

## Project conventions

Pick these unless the existing repo already decided otherwise; consistency inside one
repo beats any of them individually.

- **Layout:** `src/<package>/` with `api/`, `models/`, `services/`, `utils/`; `tests/`
  as a sibling of `src/`, never inside the package. The `src/` layout forces tests to
  run against the installed package, so a missing `__init__` or a bad packaging config
  fails in CI instead of silently passing because the cwd happened to be importable.
- **Installer:** `uv` by default (`uv venv`, `uv pip install -r requirements.txt`),
  Poetry when the project already uses it, plain `venv` as the fallback.
- **Requires-python:** `>=3.11`. Formatters and linters pinned to the same target.

```toml
[tool.black]
line-length = 100
target-version = ['py311']

[tool.ruff]
line-length = 100
select = ["E", "F", "I", "N", "W"]

[tool.mypy]
python_version = "3.11"
strict = true
warn_return_any = true
```

`strict = true` is deliberate: turning mypy on without it catches almost nothing on a
codebase that has no annotations yet, and the "we have type checking" claim becomes
false.

## Quality gate after changes

```bash
ruff check . && black --check . && mypy src/ && pytest -q
```

Run it before reporting a task done. `pytest -q` alone is not enough — a type error
that mypy would catch usually survives a green test run.

## Pitfalls worth naming

**N+1 queries.** Iterating a queryset and touching a related object issues one query
per row. `select_related('category')` for FK/one-to-one (SQL JOIN),
`prefetch_related('orders__items')` for reverse/many-to-many (second query + join in
Python). Watch for this in serializers too — a `SerializerMethodField` that walks a
relation reintroduces N+1 that the viewset's queryset had already solved.

**Read-modify-write races on counters.** `product.stock -= 1; product.save()` loses
updates whenever two requests overlap: both read the same value. Use either

```python
Product.objects.filter(id=pk, stock__gt=0).update(stock=F('stock') - 1)   # atomic in SQL
```

or `select_for_update()` inside `transaction.atomic()` when you must read the value
before deciding. `F()` is cheaper but cannot branch on the result; the row lock can.

**Loading a whole table into memory.** `list(User.objects.all())` is fine at 1k rows
and fatal at 10M. Use `.iterator(chunk_size=1000)` for one-pass processing, or
`Paginator` when you need stable page boundaries.

**Pydantic v1 idioms in a v2 project.** `orm_mode` is now `from_attributes`,
`@validator` is `@field_validator`, `.dict()` is `.model_dump()`. Check which major
version the project pins before writing models — the v1 spellings either warn or stop
working depending on the exact v2 release, and the resulting model silently does not
read ORM attributes.

**Async session leaks in FastAPI.** A `get_db` dependency must yield inside
`async with async_session() as session:` — returning a session created outside the
context manager keeps connections checked out until the pool is exhausted, which
looks like a hang under load, not like an error.

## Testing

Test DB: `sqlite+aiosqlite:///:memory:` for unit and API tests; run the migration or
`Base.metadata.create_all` in the fixture and drop it after, so tests never depend on
the order they ran in. Override the DB dependency with
`app.dependency_overrides[get_db]` and **clear it in the fixture teardown** — a
leftover override silently poisons every later test in the session.

Async tests need `pytest-asyncio` plus `@pytest.mark.asyncio`; without the marker the
coroutine is never awaited and the test passes without asserting anything.

## Deployment

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
RUN useradd -m -u 1000 appuser && chown -R appuser:appuser /app
USER appuser
EXPOSE 8000
CMD ["uvicorn", "app.main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
```

Two things are not style choices: install requirements **before** copying the source
(otherwise every code edit invalidates the dependency layer and rebuilds take minutes),
and drop to a non-root `USER` (a container escape from a root process is an escape as
root on the host).

`--reload` and bind-mounted source belong in `docker-compose.yml` for local work only;
shipping them to production means the app restarts on any file write and serves code
that is not in the image.
