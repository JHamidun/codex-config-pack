# Codex execution contract

This recipe was adapted from a pinned public source. Its domain guidance is reusable;
its historical provider examples are not a live capability registry.

1. Resolve `${CODEX_PACK_ROOT}` from the installed `hamidun-pack` entrypoint. It is a documentation root, not an environment variable automatically created by Codex.
2. Native tool mapping: Claude `Read/Glob/Grep` means available file/search tools; `Bash` means the current shell; `Write/Edit/MultiEdit` means the supported patch/file tool. Claude `Task/Agent` means native collaboration with a concrete bounded subtask, only when delegation is authorized. Tool names inside old examples are illustrative, not callable API schemas.
3. Claude slash commands become catalog recipes. They are not automatically registered as Codex slash commands. Pass arguments explicitly in the task.
4. Do not execute files ending in `.source`, upstream hook examples, or paths containing `UPSTREAM_HOME`. They are quarantined reference code, NOT a validated runtime. A dependent workflow must first receive a reviewed Codex-owned adapter with explicit state/output roots and tests, or use an available native capability.
5. Do not load secrets, session databases, private memory, or Claude model/provider defaults. Resolve integrations and named environment variables only when required and authorized.
6. Model IDs, MCP names, permission snippets and scheduled-job examples in the source are historical. Check current supported equivalents. Never activate them just because a recipe mentions them.
7. Prefer native image generation, documents and browser tooling where available. Do not install dependencies or authorize a third party as a side effect of reading this recipe.
8. Preserve scope and output requirements. Mark unavailable dependencies clearly; do not claim a recipe passed a live test from a syntax/manifest check.

## Adapted domain recipe


## When to use this skill
To write internal communications, use this skill for:
- 3P updates (Progress, Plans, Problems)
- Company newsletters
- FAQ responses
- Status reports
- Leadership updates
- Project updates
- Incident reports

## How to use this skill

To write any internal communication:

1. **Identify the communication type** from the request
2. **Load the appropriate guideline file** from the `examples/` directory:
    - `examples/3p-updates.md` - For Progress/Plans/Problems team updates
    - `examples/company-newsletter.md` - For company-wide newsletters
    - `examples/faq-answers.md` - For answering frequently asked questions
    - `examples/general-comms.md` - For anything else that doesn't explicitly match one of the above
3. **Follow the specific instructions** in that file for formatting, tone, and content gathering

If the communication type doesn't match any existing guideline, use the templates below as a starting point.

## Writing Tips

### Tone Guidelines

```markdown
✅ Do:
- Be clear and concise
- Use active voice
- Lead with the most important info
- Include specific data/metrics
- Provide clear next steps

❌ Don't:
- Use jargon without explanation
- Bury the lead
- Be vague about timelines
- Skip the "so what"
- Assume everyone has context
```

### Structure

```markdown
1. **Lead with TL;DR** - busy readers first
2. **Use headers** - scannable structure
3. **Bullet points** - easier to read
4. **Tables for data** - clear comparisons
5. **Bold key info** - highlights important
6. **End with actions** - what's next
```

### Email Subject Lines

```markdown
✅ Good:
- "[Action Required] Q4 Budget Review - Due Oct 15"
- "Weekly Update: Engineering (Oct 7-13)"
- "[FYI] New PTO Policy Effective Nov 1"
- "🎉 We Hit $1M ARR!"

❌ Bad:
- "Update"
- "Please read"
- "Important"
- "FYI"
```

## Tips

1. **Know your audience** - executives vs team vs all-hands
2. **TL;DR first** - respect busy readers
3. **Be specific** - numbers > vague statements
4. **Action-oriented** - clear next steps
5. **Consistent format** - templates save time
6. **Proofread** - typos undermine credibility
