# Codex execution contract

This recipe was adapted from a pinned public source. Its domain guidance is reusable;
its historical provider examples are not a live capability registry.

1. Resolve `${CODEX_PACK_ROOT}` from the installed `hamidun-pack` entrypoint. It is a documentation root, not an environment variable automatically created by Codex.
2. Native tool mapping: Claude `Read/Glob/Grep` means available file/search tools; `Bash` means the current shell; `Write/Edit/MultiEdit` means the supported patch/file tool. Claude `Task/Agent` means native collaboration with a concrete bounded subtask, only when delegation is authorized. Tool names inside old examples are illustrative, not callable API schemas.
3. Claude slash commands become catalog recipes. They are not automatically registered as Codex slash commands. Pass arguments explicitly in the task.
4. Do not execute files ending in `.source`, upstream hook examples, or paths containing `UPSTREAM_HOME`. They are quarantined reference code, NOT a validated runtime. A dependent workflow must first receive a reviewed Codex-owned adapter with explicit state/output roots and tests, or use an available native capability.
5. Do not load secrets, session databases, private memory, or Claude model/provider defaults. Resolve integrations and named environment variables only when required and authorized.
6. Model IDs, MCP names, permission snippets and scheduled-job examples in the source are historical. Check current supported equivalents. Never activate them just because a recipe mentions them.
7. Prefer native image generation, documents and browser tooling where available. Do not install dependencies or authorize a third party as a side effect of reading this recipe.
8. Preserve scope and output requirements. Mark unavailable dependencies clearly; do not claim a recipe passed a live test from a syntax/manifest check.

# Investor Materials

Build investor-facing materials that are consistent, credible, and easy to defend.

## When to Activate

- creating or revising a pitch deck
- writing an investor memo or one-pager
- building a financial model, milestone plan, or use-of-funds table
- answering accelerator or incubator application questions
- aligning multiple fundraising docs around one source of truth

## Golden Rule

All investor materials must agree with each other.

Create or confirm a single source of truth before writing:
- traction metrics
- pricing and revenue assumptions
- raise size and instrument
- use of funds
- team bios and titles
- milestones and timelines

If conflicting numbers appear, stop and resolve them before drafting.

## Core Workflow

1. inventory the canonical facts
2. identify missing assumptions
3. choose the asset type
4. draft the asset with explicit logic
5. cross-check every number against the source of truth

## Asset Guidance

### Pitch Deck
Recommended flow:
1. company + wedge
2. problem
3. solution
4. product / demo
5. market
6. business model
7. traction
8. team
9. competition / differentiation
10. ask
11. use of funds / milestones
12. appendix

If the user wants a web-native deck, pair this skill with `frontend-slides`.

### One-Pager / Memo
- state what the company does in one clean sentence
- show why now
- include traction and proof points early
- make the ask precise
- keep claims easy to verify

### Financial Model
Include:
- explicit assumptions
- bear / base / bull cases when useful
- clean layer-by-layer revenue logic
- milestone-linked spending
- sensitivity analysis where the decision hinges on assumptions

### Accelerator Applications
- answer the exact question asked
- prioritize traction, insight, and team advantage
- avoid puffery
- keep internal metrics consistent with the deck and model

## Red Flags to Avoid

- unverifiable claims
- fuzzy market sizing without assumptions
- inconsistent team roles or titles
- revenue math that does not sum cleanly
- inflated certainty where assumptions are fragile

## Quality Gate

Before delivering:
- every number matches the current source of truth
- use of funds and revenue layers sum correctly
- assumptions are visible, not buried
- the story is clear without hype language
- the final asset is defensible in a partner meeting
