# Codex execution contract

This recipe was adapted from a pinned public source. Its domain guidance is reusable;
its historical provider examples are not a live capability registry.

1. Resolve `${CODEX_PACK_ROOT}` from the installed `hamidun-pack` entrypoint. It is a documentation root, not an environment variable automatically created by Codex.
2. Native tool mapping: Claude `Read/Glob/Grep` means available file/search tools; `Bash` means the current shell; `Write/Edit/MultiEdit` means the supported patch/file tool. Claude `Task/Agent` means native collaboration with a concrete bounded subtask, only when delegation is authorized. Tool names inside old examples are illustrative, not callable API schemas.
3. Claude slash commands become catalog recipes. They are not automatically registered as Codex slash commands. Pass arguments explicitly in the task.
4. Do not execute files ending in `.source`, upstream hook examples, or paths containing `UPSTREAM_HOME`. They are quarantined reference code, NOT a validated runtime. A dependent workflow must first receive a reviewed Codex-owned adapter with explicit state/output roots and tests, or use an available native capability.
5. Do not load secrets, session databases, private memory, or Claude model/provider defaults. Resolve integrations and named environment variables only when required and authorized.
6. Model IDs, MCP names, permission snippets and scheduled-job examples in the source are historical. Check current supported equivalents. Never activate them just because a recipe mentions them.
7. Prefer native image generation, documents and browser tooling where available. Do not install dependencies or authorize a third party as a side effect of reading this recipe.
8. Preserve scope and output requirements. Mark unavailable dependencies clearly; do not claim a recipe passed a live test from a syntax/manifest check.

## Adapted domain recipe


# Manus AI (API v2)

Manus (manus.im) is a cloud autonomous-agent platform. You hand it a natural-language
task; a Manus agent plans and runs it asynchronously (browser, code sandbox, files,
connectors) and returns messages/artifacts. This skill drives it through the official
REST API v2 via `scripts/manus_helper.py`.

## When to use

- A self-planning, multi-step job that runs unattended for minutes: deep web research,
  scraping + structuring, "go to X, download report, summarize", generate a document.
- You want the work done in Manus's own cloud sandbox, not in this session.

**When NOT to use:**

- Slides/decks "in the style of Manus" → skill `manus-slides`.
- Simple/local browser clicks or scraping you control step-by-step → `dev-browser`,
  `playwright-automation`, `apify-scraping`.
- Quick web answer with citations → `deep-research` (Perplexity).

## Verified facts (checked against open.manus.im/docs + live calls, 2026-07-22)

- Base URL: `https://api.manus.ai`
- Auth header: `x-manus-api-key: <MANUS_API_KEY>` (OAuth2 Bearer also supported).
  Key is in `${CODEX_PACK_ROOT}/library/.credentials.master.env` as `MANUS_API_KEY`.
- **v2 is current; v1 (`/v1/tasks`, header `API_KEY`) is deprecated** — do not use it.
- Create is `POST /v2/task.create`; the task runs **async**. You poll for progress.
- `agent_profile` values: `manus-1.6` (default), `manus-1.6-lite` (fast/cheap),
  `manus-1.6-max` (best quality).
- Lifecycle `agent_status`: `running` → `stopped` (success) | `error` (failed) |
  `waiting` (needs your input). Field lives at `messages[].status_update.agent_status`.
- Final answer text is at `messages[].assistant_message.content` (newest first when
  `order=desc`). Structured output at `structured_output_result` if a schema was passed.

Endpoints (see `references/api-v2.md` for the full map): `task.create` (POST),
`task.listMessages` (GET, query params), `task.detail` (GET), `task.sendMessage` (POST),
`task.stop` (POST), `task.list`, `task.delete`, `file.upload`.

> Honest note: only the endpoints exercised by `manus_helper.py` (create / listMessages /
> status / sendMessage / stop) have been run live from here. `file.upload`, connectors and
> skills are documented by Manus but **not yet tested in this skill** — treat as reference.

## Procedure

Prefer the helper over hand-rolled `requests` — it handles the async poll loop and the
nested `status_update` / `assistant_message` field parsing correctly.

```bash
# one-shot: create + poll until done, prints JSON with .answer
python ${CODEX_PACK_ROOT}/library/skills/manus/scripts/manus_helper.py run \
  "Research the top 5 Russian EdTech AI products in 2026; output a comparison table" \
  --profile manus-1.6 --timeout 1800 --poll 8

# fire-and-forget (returns task_id + task_url immediately)
python ${CODEX_PACK_ROOT}/library/skills/manus/scripts/manus_helper.py create "…prompt…" --profile manus-1.6-lite

# poll a task you started earlier
python ${CODEX_PACK_ROOT}/library/skills/manus/scripts/manus_helper.py status   <task_id>
python ${CODEX_PACK_ROOT}/library/skills/manus/scripts/manus_helper.py messages <task_id> --limit 20

# answer a task that went agent_status=waiting, or add a follow-up
python ${CODEX_PACK_ROOT}/library/skills/manus/scripts/manus_helper.py reply <task_id> "yes, proceed"

# stop a runaway task
python ${CODEX_PACK_ROOT}/library/skills/manus/scripts/manus_helper.py stop <task_id>
```

The key must be in the environment. In bash:
`set -a; source ${CODEX_PACK_ROOT}/library/.credentials.master.env; set +a` before the call.

## Output

`run` prints JSON to stdout:

```json
{
  "task_id": "REumuUf3XoZBGMgUZF7yad",
  "task_url": "https://manus.im/app/REumuUf3XoZBGMgUZF7yad",
  "agent_status": "stopped",
  "answer": "…the agent's final message text…",
  "messages": { "messages": [ … full event log … ] }
}
```

Exit codes: `0` stopped/waiting, `2` error, `3` timeout. Progress (`task_id`,
`agent_status`) is streamed to **stderr** so stdout stays parseable.

## Example

```bash
$ set -a; source ${CODEX_PACK_ROOT}/library/.credentials.master.env; set +a
$ python ${CODEX_PACK_ROOT}/library/skills/manus/scripts/manus_helper.py run \
    "Reply with exactly the word PONG and nothing else." --profile manus-1.6-lite
# stderr: task_id=… / agent_status=running / agent_status=stopped
# stdout: {"agent_status":"stopped","answer":"PONG", …}
```

## Checklist

- [ ] `MANUS_API_KEY` exported before calling the helper.
- [ ] Chose profile: `manus-1.6-lite` for cheap/fast, `manus-1.6` default, `manus-1.6-max` for hard jobs.
- [ ] Long jobs: set `--timeout` generously (default 1800s) — Manus runs can take many minutes.
- [ ] If result is `agent_status=waiting`, use `reply` to unblock; if `error`, read `messages` for `error_message`.
- [ ] Autonomy ≠ correctness — verify the returned artifact/answer before shipping.

## Tips

1. Detailed prompt = better run. Spell out inputs, steps, and the exact output format.
2. Break very large jobs into a few smaller tasks rather than one mega-prompt.
3. Pass `--locale ru` (via `create`/`run` code path) to force Russian output.
4. For structured extraction, call `create_task(..., structured_schema=<JSON Schema>)`
   in Python and read `structured_output_result`.
5. Manus API billing is metered per task/usage on the Manus account — prefer `-lite`
   for drafts and cheap iterations.
