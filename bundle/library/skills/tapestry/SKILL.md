# Codex execution contract

This recipe was adapted from a pinned public source. Its domain guidance is reusable;
its historical provider examples are not a live capability registry.

1. Resolve `${CODEX_PACK_ROOT}` from the installed `hamidun-pack` entrypoint. It is a documentation root, not an environment variable automatically created by Codex.
2. Native tool mapping: Claude `Read/Glob/Grep` means available file/search tools; `Bash` means the current shell; `Write/Edit/MultiEdit` means the supported patch/file tool. Claude `Task/Agent` means native collaboration with a concrete bounded subtask, only when delegation is authorized. Tool names inside old examples are illustrative, not callable API schemas.
3. Claude slash commands become catalog recipes. They are not automatically registered as Codex slash commands. Pass arguments explicitly in the task.
4. Do not execute files ending in `.source`, upstream hook examples, or paths containing `UPSTREAM_HOME`. They are quarantined reference code, NOT a validated runtime. A dependent workflow must first receive a reviewed Codex-owned adapter with explicit state/output roots and tests, or use an available native capability.
5. Do not load secrets, session databases, private memory, or Claude model/provider defaults. Resolve integrations and named environment variables only when required and authorized.
6. Model IDs, MCP names, permission snippets and scheduled-job examples in the source are historical. Check current supported equivalents. Never activate them just because a recipe mentions them.
7. Prefer native image generation, documents and browser tooling where available. Do not install dependencies or authorize a third party as a side effect of reading this recipe.
8. Preserve scope and output requirements. Mark unavailable dependencies clearly; do not claim a recipe passed a live test from a syntax/manifest check.

# Tapestry — Knowledge Weaving

> Use when: "tapestry", "weave", "свяжи документы", "граф знаний", "knowledge graph", "interlink docs"
> Interlinks documents into knowledge networks with implementation plans.

## Overview

Tapestry weaves learning content into actionable knowledge:
1. Extract content from any source (YouTube, articles, PDFs, code)
2. Identify connections and patterns between documents
3. Create interlinked knowledge graphs
4. Generate implementation plans from extracted knowledge

## Workflow

### Step 1: Extract Sources

```bash
# YouTube transcripts (existing skill: youtube-transcript.md)
# Articles (WebFetch tool)
# PDFs (existing skill: document-skills/pdf/)
# Code documentation (Glob + Read tools)
```

### Step 2: Weave Knowledge Graph

For each set of sources, create a knowledge map:

```markdown
## Knowledge Graph: [Topic]

### Core Concepts
1. **Concept A** — definition
   - Related to: Concept B, Concept D
   - Source: [video1], [article2]

2. **Concept B** — definition
   - Depends on: Concept A
   - Contradicts: Concept C (from [article3])
   - Source: [article1], [pdf1]

### Connections
- A → B: "A enables B because..."
- B ↔ D: "bidirectional relationship..."
- C conflicts with E: "different approaches to..."

### Gaps
- No source covers: [missing topic]
- Conflicting views on: [topic] between [source1] and [source2]

### Implementation Priority
1. [Most actionable insight] — from [source]
2. [Second priority] — from [source]
3. [Requires more research] — gap identified
```

### Step 3: Generate Action Plan

Transform knowledge graph into concrete steps:

```markdown
## Action Plan: [Topic]

### Phase 1: Foundation (from Concepts A, B)
- [ ] Task 1 — based on [source] insight
- [ ] Task 2 — addresses [gap]

### Phase 2: Implementation (from Concepts C, D)
- [ ] Task 3 — applies [pattern] from [source]
- [ ] Task 4 — resolves [conflict] between approaches

### Phase 3: Validation
- [ ] Verify against [source] recommendations
- [ ] Test [concept] in practice
```

## Usage Patterns

### Research Synthesis
```
"Weave these 5 articles about [topic] into a knowledge graph"
→ Extract key concepts → Find connections → Identify gaps → Action plan
```

### Documentation Audit
```
"Tapestry: analyze our docs/ folder for completeness"
→ Map all documented concepts → Find undocumented areas → Priority list
```

### Learning Path
```
"Create a learning path from these YouTube videos and articles"
→ Extract concepts → Order by dependency → Create study plan
```

### Competitive Analysis
```
"Weave competitor docs into comparison matrix"
→ Extract features → Map overlaps → Identify differentiators
```

## Integration with Existing Skills

| Source Type | Extraction Skill | Then |
|-------------|-----------------|------|
| YouTube | `youtube-transcript` | Tapestry weave |
| Articles | `content-research` | Tapestry weave |
| PDFs | `pdf` | Tapestry weave |
| Code | Agent `code-reviewer` | Tapestry weave |
| Meetings | `tldv` | Tapestry weave |

## Output Format

Knowledge graphs are saved as Markdown files in the project directory:
- `knowledge-graph-[topic].md` — the graph itself
- `action-plan-[topic].md` — generated action plan

## Notes

- Based on [tapestry-skills-for-claude-code](https://github.com/michalparkola/tapestry-skills-for-claude-code)
- Works best with 3-10 sources on a related topic
- Can be combined with vector_memory for persistent knowledge storage
- For visual graphs, use Mermaid diagrams or excalidraw-flowchart skill
